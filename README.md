## A Star Wars website

In this project i created a mobile first, reactive star wars website using Material UI for the first time.

### Inspiration

I've always been a fan of star wars from the first time i saw the movie "Star Wars A New Hope" I fell in love. It's kind of like programming in a way, see in Star Wars one of the main charatcers Luke Skywalker lost faith in having the ability to become one of the best jedi masters. Although he couldnt see himself as a jedi legend, it was with time practice and dedication he would rise to be the great master he was. I feel a deep connection with Luke because in programming you have to have hard work and dedication to become a great programmer.
 

### Steps taken to make this website

1. Research Material UI and come up with a layout.
2. What components can i use to show my skills as a developer
3. how can i make my UI attractive to the user and wow them, what colors and effects can i add to keep the user attention wanting to stay on my page .
4. Implement a home page to where a give a brief description on what exactly Star Wars is, if a user is unsure or never heard about Star Wars. 

### Challenegs faced
 1. Some of the Challenegs i faced for starters was how to add pictures to my site using Material UI. With Material UI the only way you can get a picture to render is by making sure u set a height, other wise the picture will not show. Took some time but by reading the docs i was able to overcome this challenge. 
 2. Using the useEffect hook when doing my API calls as well as the async and await methods. This was probably one of the hardest parts of trying to make one of my pages to render only movies containing the words "Star Wars"..But again with practice anything is possible. One way i overcome this challenge was going back to the URL in my API folder i created containing the file Query.js and changing the query part of the Url to "query=star-wars". This actually render only the movies i needed which contained the title "Star Wars" to show on the page.
